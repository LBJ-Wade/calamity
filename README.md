# <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">calamity</span>
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">calamity</span> is a frequency regulated self-cal strategy that simultaneously fits for calibration solutions with foregrounds that are described by a well understood / behaved set of  basis vectors. Examples of basis sets that do not incorporate inter-baseline correlations are DPSS vectors and DFT vectors. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">calamity</span> can also handle fitting modes with inter-baseline correlations to reduce sample variance and potentially recover modes inside of the wedge.
