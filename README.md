# CALAMITY -- A Radio Interferometer Calibration Tool that Requires No Redundancy and Minimal Prior Knowledge on Foregrounds and Beams

## Summary
CALibration AMITY (CALAMITY) is a frequency regulated self-cal strategy that simultaneously fits for calibration solutions with foregrounds that are described by a well understood / behaved set of  basis vectors. Examples of basis sets that do not incorporate inter-baseline correlations are DPSS vectors and DFT vectors. 

CALAMITY: increasing the amity between fluctuations in the 21cm field and radio interferometry.

## Installation. 
You can install `calamity` with `pip` by running `pip install git+https://github.com/aewallwi/calamity.git` in your terminal.

## Getting Started.
